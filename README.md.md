## 🔍 Phishing Indicators Found

- **Fake Sender Address:** `@paypalsecure.com` is not an official PayPal domain.
- **Urgent Language:** The message pressures the user to act fast (“within 24 hours”).
- **Suspicious Link:** The link leads to a fake site (`paypal-verification.com`) instead of the real `paypal.com`.
- **Generic Greeting:** Uses “Dear Customer” instead of the user’s real name.
- **Threatening Tone:** Implies account suspension to scare the user.
- **Social Engineering:** Uses fear and urgency to trick the user into clicking the link.

## 🧠 Conclusion

This email is a clear example of a phishing attack. It uses spoofed sender information, social engineering tactics like urgency and fear, and a fake link to steal user credentials. Users should always check sender details, hover over links before clicking, and never respond to threatening emails without verifying them first.
